# G Heavy Footprints

This library contains information and KiCad footprints for neat gHeavy Industries stuff.

Currently this includes:
- gJumper 		: A zero cost I2C connection that fits under a MX switch
- gInterface	: Universal interface for Gergo and other modules (footprint contains pinout info)
